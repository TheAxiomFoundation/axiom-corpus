# Corpus Pipeline

The durable corpus contract is source-first:

1. snapshot official source material
2. build an independent source inventory
3. extract normalized provision records with provenance
4. compare inventory coverage to normalized provisions
5. load Supabase/search/reference indexes from normalized provisions
6. publish corpus-specific JSONL or database exports from normalized provisions

## Source Eligibility

Default corpus inputs are primary official sources: enacted statutes, adopted
regulations, agency manuals, state plans, waiver approvals, policy memoranda,
and other documents issued by the authority responsible for the policy.

Compiled or analytical secondary sources, including federal or third-party
reports that summarize state choices, should not be ingested as corpus sources
by default. They can be used as QA checklists or gap-finding references outside
the corpus contract. If a compiled source becomes necessary, add it deliberately
as its own document class with explicit provenance and do not let it substitute
for available primary documents.

External model repositories and citation lists can also be used for discovery,
but not as pipeline dependencies. For example, PolicyEngine-US references are a
useful offline checklist for finding official policy documents; corpus
ingestion must still re-fetch primary official sources directly and preserve
only the external citation path as discovery provenance. See
`docs/source-discovery-checklist.md`.

## Storage

The artifact root is designed to map directly to R2:

```text
sources/{jurisdiction}/{document_class}/{run_id}/...
inventory/{jurisdiction}/{document_class}/{run_id}.json
provisions/{jurisdiction}/{document_class}/{version}.jsonl
coverage/{jurisdiction}/{document_class}/{version}.json
exports/{format}/{jurisdiction}/{document_class}/{version}/...
analytics/{version}.json
objects/sha256/{prefix}/{artifact_sha256}
releases/{release}/{release_content_sha256}.json
```

R2 should hold official source snapshots, source inventories, normalized
provision JSONL, coverage reports, analytics snapshots, and corpus exports.
Supabase should hold derived indexes such as `corpus.provisions`,
`corpus.provision_references`, search functions, embeddings, and count views.

Do not put generated interchange XML in the main source/provision path. Format
conversion belongs outside `axiom_corpus.corpus`; corpus ingestion should depend
only on source snapshots, inventories, normalized provisions, coverage, and
derived database/search indexes.

Artifact sync is explicit and dry-run first:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest sync-r2 \
  --base data/corpus

axiom-corpus-ingest sync-r2 \
  --base data/corpus \
  --prefix sources \
  --prefix inventory \
  --jurisdiction us-co \
  --document-class policy \
  --version 2026-04-30 \
  --apply
```

Use `artifact-report` to compare local artifacts, optional R2 objects, coverage,
and Supabase count snapshots by `jurisdiction + document_class + version`:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest artifact-report \
  --base data/corpus \
  --supabase-counts data/corpus/snapshots/provision-counts-2026-04-30.json \
  --include-r2 \
  --output data/corpus/analytics/artifact-report-2026-04-30.json
```

Bare named selector plans resolve only to the tracked
`manifests/releases/<name>.json`; callers may instead pass that explicit path.
Selectors must use an immutable name and `current` is reserved. Use
`--release <name>` for a selected diagnostic report or `--all-scopes` for an
exhaustive report. Production selection comes only from the signed database
pointer.

The publication controller creates the only authoritative release object after
R2 readback, exact database counts, and deep validation:

```bash
python scripts/publish_corpus.py \
  --release manifests/releases/nz-rulespec-2026-07-10.json \
  --dry-run
```

Before promoting or publishing a release, validate the release against local
artifacts, optional R2 presence, Supabase count snapshots, persisted coverage,
and basic provision invariants:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest validate-release \
  --base data/corpus \
  --release nz-rulespec-2026-07-10 \
  --supabase-counts data/corpus/snapshots/provision-counts-2026-05-02.json \
  --include-r2
```

See `docs/named-release-publication.md` for the signing and transactional
activation contract.

## Federal eCFR

The eCFR adapter uses structure JSON for independent inventory and full title
XML for official source snapshots plus normalized provision extraction.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest inventory-ecfr \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --as-of 2024-04-16

axiom-corpus-ingest extract-ecfr \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --as-of 2024-04-16 \
  --expression-date 2024-04-16 \
  --workers 2 \
  --allow-incomplete
```

Use an eCFR date that the public API actually serves. The corpus version can be
the local build or release date; the source `as_of` date remains provenance.

Targeted rebuilds are scoped and do not certify the whole source:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-ecfr \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --as-of 2024-04-16 \
  --only-title 7 \
  --only-part 273
```

When `--only-title`, `--only-part`, or `--limit` is supplied, the run id is
derived from the base version, for example
`2026-04-29-title-7-part-273`. Part-scoped eCFR extraction snapshots the part
XML endpoint, not a whole-title XML file.

## Federal Register Activity

The Federal Register adapter is for regulatory activity, not compiled law. It
uses `document_class=rulemaking` and snapshots FederalRegister.gov API result
pages plus per-document metadata and raw text when available. This covers the
feed Marci Harris's institutional AI proposal calls out: proposed rules, final
rules, notices, guidance-like notices, enforcement-related notices, comment
deadlines, effective dates, agencies, dockets, RINs, and CFR references.

FederalRegister.gov's API does not require an API key. Treat this as the
activity stream that may later amend compiled eCFR text; do not merge it into
the eCFR `regulation` scope.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-federal-register \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-05-15 \
  --start-date 2026-05-01 \
  --end-date 2026-05-15
```

The default types are `RULE`, `PRORULE`, and `NOTICE`. Narrow smoke runs can
use `--document-type`, `--term`, and `--limit`; those filters become part of the
run id so a targeted sample is not confused with a complete daily or monthly
feed.

## Federal US Code

The US Code adapter ingests official USLM XML by title. It snapshots the XML
under `sources/us/statute/{run_id}/uslm/`, derives a title/section source
inventory from the XML identifiers, and writes normalized provision JSONL.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-usc \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --source-xml data/uscode/usc26.xml
```

The title is inferred from USLM `docNumber` or identifiers by default. If
`--source-as-of` and `--expression-date` are omitted, the adapter uses each
USLM file's `dcterms:created` date when present. Targeted smoke runs can use
`--limit`; that produces a scoped run id such as `2026-04-29-title-26-limit-25`
and only certifies coverage for that scoped inventory.

For a complete local US Code source directory:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-usc-dir \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --source-dir data/uscode
```

That writes combined artifacts at `inventory/us/statute/{version}.json`,
`provisions/us/statute/{version}.jsonl`, and
`coverage/us/statute/{version}.json`.

## Colorado

Colorado statutes are ingested from the official CRS DOCX release:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-colorado-docx \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --release-dir data/statutes/us-co/2025-crs
```

Colorado regulations are ingested from current Secretary of State CCR PDFs and
rule-info pages. Use `--download-dir` for a first official snapshot; use
`--release-dir` to rebuild normalized records from a saved snapshot without
re-fetching the state site.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-colorado-ccr \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --download-dir data/regulations/us-co/ccr-2026-04-13
```

The SNAP rule manual is part of the CCR source as `10 CCR 2506-1`, so it is
loaded under `us-co/regulation` with rule-manual metadata rather than as a
separate corpus class.

## State Statutes

Production state statute ingestion should be manifest-driven so each active
scope has a reproducible adapter, source path, source date, and corpus version.
The current active state statute batch is tracked at
`manifests/state-statutes.current.yaml`.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-state-statutes \
  --base data/corpus \
  --manifest manifests/state-statutes.current.yaml \
  --dry-run

axiom-corpus-ingest extract-state-statutes \
  --base data/corpus \
  --manifest manifests/state-statutes.current.yaml
```

Use `--only-jurisdiction`, `--only-source-id`, and `--limit-per-source` for
smoke runs or targeted rebuilds. Supported state statute adapters are
`dc-code`, `cic-html`, `cic-odt`, `colorado-docx`, `texas-tcas`,
`ohio-revised-code`, `minnesota-statutes`,
`nebraska-revised-statutes`, `washington-rcw`,
`california-codes-bulk`, and `local-state-html`.

The `nebraska-revised-statutes` adapter snapshots the official Nebraska
Legislature statute index, chapter TOCs, and per-section HTML pages. Its
manifest entry can fetch live official sources or rebuild from a saved
`source_dir`; do not add the Nebraska release scope to `current` until a full
run has completed, coverage validates, and the artifacts are published.

`local-state-html` snapshots cached official HTML files and converts them into
the same source-first inventory, provision JSONL, and coverage artifacts as the
other adapters. Treat the checked-in
`manifests/state-statutes.local-html-smoke.yaml` manifest as a migration smoke
path only: its cached directories are not presumed to be complete official
state-code releases, so they should not be added to `current` until source
completeness has been separately established.

Use `state-statute-completion` for the production completion view across all
50 states plus DC. The report compares expected jurisdictions against the
current release, local source-first artifacts, optional R2 objects, Supabase
count snapshots, and the latest `validate-release` output. It distinguishes
productionized states from local-but-unpromoted, Supabase-only legacy, partial,
and missing source-first extractions.

Use `regulation-completion` for the same production completion view across
federal regulations plus every state and DC. This is intentionally broader than
the current release: today it identifies the completed federal eCFR and Colorado
CCR scopes and leaves the remaining state regulation jurisdictions in the
source-first backlog.

Use `docs/agent-ingestion-runbook.md` and
`manifests/state-statute-agent-queue.yaml` when assigning parallel agent work.
The queue separates validated states, release-repair states, and states that
are ready for one-agent-per-jurisdiction source-first adapter work.

```bash
export RELEASE_SELECTOR=manifests/releases/immutable-release-name.json
axiom-corpus-ingest state-statute-completion \
  --base data/corpus \
  --release "$RELEASE_SELECTOR" \
  --supabase-counts data/corpus/snapshots/provision-counts-2026-05-10.json \
  --include-r2 \
  --output data/corpus/analytics/state-statute-completion-current.json

axiom-corpus-ingest regulation-completion \
  --base data/corpus \
  --release "$RELEASE_SELECTOR" \
  --supabase-counts data/corpus/snapshots/provision-counts-2026-05-10.json \
  --include-r2 \
  --output data/corpus/analytics/regulation-completion-current.json
```

Replace `immutable-release-name` with the exact named selector being audited;
completion reports never resolve a mutable release alias.

Primary SNAP policy documents that are not codified in CCR can be ingested from
an explicit official-document manifest. This is for primary sources such as
state plans, waiver approvals, agency memoranda, and agency policy pages. Do not
add compiled State Options Report-style summaries to this manifest.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest extract-official-documents \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-30 \
  --manifest manifests/us-co-snap-primary-policy.yaml
```

## Coverage

Coverage compares expected source inventory citations to normalized provision
citations. It does not depend on any external interchange format.

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest coverage \
  --base data/corpus \
  --source-inventory data/corpus/inventory/us/regulation/2026-04-29.json \
  --provisions data/corpus/provisions/us/regulation/2026-04-29.jsonl \
  --jurisdiction us \
  --document-class regulation \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --write
```

## Supabase

Supabase is current derived/indexed state, not the durable historical corpus.
R2 artifacts and release artifact manifests are the source of truth for
historical versions. Supabase rows are keyed for the current searchable corpus,
so loading a newer provision with the same citation path updates that current
index rather than preserving side-by-side historical versions.

The ingestion importer maps normalized provision JSONL into
`corpus.provisions`, then refreshes `corpus.provision_counts`.

The exact row projection is generated with:

```bash
axiom-corpus-ingest export-supabase \
  --provisions data/corpus/provisions/us/regulation/2026-04-29-title-7-part-273.jsonl \
  --output data/corpus/exports/supabase/us/regulation/2026-04-29-title-7-part-273.jsonl
```

The projection includes deterministic `id`/`parent_id`, hierarchy (`level`,
`ordinal`), provenance (`source_url`, `source_path`, `source_document_id`,
`source_as_of`, `expression_date`), and lightweight metadata fields
(`language`, `legal_identifier`, `identifiers`) that can map to ELI and
schema.org Legislation without making either ontology the internal schema.

To load the projected records into Supabase directly from normalized provision
JSONL:

```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... axiom-corpus-ingest load-supabase \
  --provisions data/corpus/provisions/us/regulation/2026-04-29-title-7-part-273.jsonl
```

If `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is not set, the loader can retrieve it through
the Supabase Management API using `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Use `--dry-run` to
validate row counts and projection without credentials or network writes.

Production count analytics are document-class aware:

```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=... axiom-corpus-ingest snapshot-provision-counts \
  --output data/corpus/snapshots/provision-counts-2026-04-29.json

axiom-corpus-ingest analytics \
  --base data/corpus \
  --version 2026-04-29 \
  --supabase-counts data/corpus/snapshots/provision-counts-2026-04-29.json \
  --write
```

`corpus.provision_counts` is a derived-row count surface. It is not a source
completeness claim; use coverage reports for that.
