# DC Law XML Import Guide

This document describes the structure of the DC Council's law-xml repository and how to extract tax provisions for use with RuleSpec.

## Repository Overview

- **Codified D.C. Code source**: https://github.com/DCCouncil/law-xml-codified,
  path `us/dc/council/code/titles/<title>/`. This is the XML that
  code.dccouncil.gov serves.
- **Session-law source (not the Code)**: https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law-xml
- **Format**: XML with custom DC Council schema
- **Scope**: District of Columbia statutes and code

### Which branch is current

`law-xml-codified` publishes one branch per codification run. On 2026-05-23 the
Council re-rooted its history as `publication/2026-05-23`; that branch and its
`publication/2026-05-23.<date>` snapshots carry every update since. The
repository's default branch, `publication/2021-10-18`, is a separate root whose
last commit is 2026-05-19, so it is stale. Before an ingest, take the most
recently committed `publication/*` branch and confirm against the live site. For
example, D.C. Code § 47-1803.02(a)(2)(BBB), added 2026-08-26, is on
code.dccouncil.gov and on `publication/2026-05-23` but not on the default branch.
Record the branch and commit in the ingest manifest command, because the
extractor does not record them in provision rows.

### Do not ingest the Code from `dc-law-xml`

`dc-law-xml` still contains a `us/dc/council/code/titles` tree, but it is not
the maintained Code. At `dc-law-xml` main `a685aaa` (2026-09-23), the newest
history note in its title 47 sections is D.C. Law 21-98 and in title 4 D.C. Law
22-65, although a few files there were touched as late as 2024.
`us-dc/statute/2026-05-19-title-4` and
`us-dc/statute/2026-07-16-pit-east-title-47` were extracted from it with a
hardcoded `source_as_of` of 2025-12-23, so their text is about ten years older
than their dates claim. `us-dc/statute/2026-09-26-codified-title-47` replaces
the title 47 scope from `law-xml-codified`
(`docs/ingest-runs/2026-09-26-dc-title-47-codified-and-eitc-sources.md`).

### Temporary and permanent versions

When emergency or temporary legislation amends a section, `titles/<n>/sections/`
holds the version that includes it, with a leading `*NOTE: ... will expire on
<date> ...*` paragraph. The permanent text is at `titles/99/<section>(Perm).xml`.
The extractor reads `sections/` only, so rows carry the temporary version and
their `expression_date` must be a date on which it was in force.

### Legacy notes

The rest of this guide describes the older `dc-law-xml` layout; the section XML
schema (`section`, `para`, `num`, `heading`, `text`, `table`) is the same in
both repositories.

- **Legacy local clone**: `sources/dc/dc-law-xml/`

## XML Schema

The DC Law XML uses custom namespaces defined in the `schemas/` directory:

| Schema File | Namespace | Purpose |

## Key Tax Sections for RuleSpec

### Individual Income Tax

| Section | Description | RuleSpec Concept |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 47-1801.04(26) | Standard deduction definition | `dc_standard_deduction` parameter |
| 47-1801.04(43) | Personal exemption definition | `dc_personal_exemption` parameter |
| 47-1806.02 | Personal exemptions | `dc_personal_exemptions` variable |
| 47-1806.03 | **Tax rates (brackets)** | `dc_income_tax_brackets` parameter |
| 47-1806.04(f) | **DC EITC (40% of federal)** | `dc_eitc` variable |

| 47-1806.04(c) | Child care credit | `dc_child_care_credit` variable |

### Current Tax Rates (Section 47-1806.03)

As of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015 (paragraph 10):

**For taxable income (all filers):**

| Bracket | Rate | Base Tax |
|---------|------|----------|
| $0 - $10,000 | 4% | $0 |
| $10,000 - $40,000 | 6% | $400 |
| $40,000 - $60,000 | 6.5% (subject to funding) | $2,200 |
| $60,000 - $350,000 | 8.5% | $3,500 |
| $350,000 - $1,000,000 | 8.75% | $28,150 |
| Over $1,000,000 | 8.95% | $85,025 |

Note: DC uses a single rate schedule for all filers (no separate married/single brackets).

### DC EITC (Section 47-1806.04(f))

- **With qualifying child**: 40% of federal EITC
- **Without qualifying child**: Custom calculation in subsection (f)(1)(C)
  - Uses modified phase-in and phase-out from federal
  - Phaseout percentage: 8.48%
  - Phaseout amount: $17,235 (adjusted for cost-of-living)
- **Refundable**: Yes

### Standard Deduction (Section 47-1801.04(26))

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014:

| Filing Status | Base Amount |
|--------------|-------------|
| Single | $5,200 (adjusted for COLA) |
| Head of Household | $6,500 (adjusted for COLA) |
| Married Filing Jointly / Surviving Spouse | $8,350 (adjusted for COLA) |
| Married Filing Separately | Half of single amount |

## Parsing XML for Tax Provisions

### Sample XPath Queries

```python
# Get all sections in Title 47
//container[@num='47']//section

# Get income tax rate table
//section[@num='47-1806.03']//table

# Get EITC provisions
//section[@num='47-1806.04']//para[@num='(f)']

# Get standard deduction definition
//section[@num='47-1801.04']//para[@num='(26)']
```

### Extracting Values from Tables

DC tax rate tables are embedded in `<table>` elements:

```xml
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Not over $10,000</td>
      <td>4% of the taxable income.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Over $10,000 but not over $40,000</td>
      <td>$400, plus 6% of the excess over $10,000.</td>
    </tr>
    <!-- ... -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Parsing Bracket Text

The rate description follows a pattern:
- **Base amount**: "$X, plus"
- **Rate**: "Y% of the excess over"
- **Threshold**: "$Z"

Regex pattern:
```python
r'\$?([\d,]+)(?:,\s*plus)?\s*([\d.]+)%\s*(?:of the (?:taxable income|excess over \$?([\d,]+)))?'
```

## Mapping to RuleSpec Concepts

### XML Element to RuleSpec Mapping

| DC XML | RuleSpec | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `<section>/@num` | Variable/Parameter name | e.g., "47-1806.03" -> `dc_income_tax_rates` |
| `<table>` in rate section | Bracket parameter | Parse to threshold/rate arrays |
| `<meta>/<effective>` | Parameter effective dates | When law took effect |
| `<annotation type="History">` | Reference metadata | Legislative history |
| `<cite path="...">` | Cross-references | Links between sections |

### Example RuleSpec Parameter

From Section 47-1806.03(10):

```yaml
# parameters/dc/income_tax/brackets.yaml
dc_income_tax_brackets:
  description: DC individual income tax rate brackets
  reference:
    - title: "D.C. Code Section 47-1806.03(a)(10)"
      href: "https://code.dccouncil.us/us/dc/council/code/sections/47-1806.03.html"
  values:
    2016-01-01:
      - threshold: 0
        rate: 0.04
        base: 0
      - threshold: 10_000
        rate: 0.06
        base: 400
      - threshold: 40_000
        rate: 0.065  # subject to funding
        base: 2_200
      - threshold: 60_000
        rate: 0.085
        base: 3_500
      - threshold: 350_000
        rate: 0.0875
        base: 28_150
      - threshold: 1_000_000
        rate: 0.0895
        base: 85_025
```

### Example RuleSpec Variable

From Section 47-1806.04(f):

```python
# variables/dc/credits/eitc.py
class dc_eitc(Variable):
    """DC Earned Income Tax Credit"""
    value_type = float
    entity = TaxUnit
    definition_period = YEAR
    reference = "https://code.dccouncil.us/us/dc/council/code/sections/47-1806.04.html#(f)"

    def formula(tax_unit, period, parameters):
        federal_eitc = tax_unit("eitc", period)
        has_qualifying_child = tax_unit.any(
            tax_unit.members("is_eitc_qualifying_child", period)
        )

        # With qualifying child: 40% of federal EITC
        with_child = federal_eitc * 0.40

        # Without qualifying child: custom calculation
        # (See subsection (f)(1)(C) for details)
        without_child = calculate_childless_dc_eitc(tax_unit, period, parameters)

        return where(has_qualifying_child, with_child, without_child)
```

## Import Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Tax Provisions

1. Extract Title 47 sections
2. Parse income tax rate tables
3. Extract EITC percentages
4. Extract standard deduction amounts
5. Generate RuleSpec parameter files

### Phase 2: Credits and Deductions

1. Low income credit (47-1806.04(e))
2. Child care credit (47-1806.04(c))
3. Personal exemptions (47-1806.02)
4. Itemized deduction limitations

### Phase 3: Full Code Import

1. All Title 47 sections
2. Historical rate changes
3. Amendment tracking
4. Cross-reference resolution

## Using the Extraction Script

```bash
# Extract DC tax provisions
python scripts/extract_dc_tax.py

# Output files will be in:
# - output/dc/brackets.yaml
# - output/dc/eitc.yaml
# - output/dc/standard_deduction.yaml
```
